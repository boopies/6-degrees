App Summary:
6-Degrees is a search app which uses the Tastedive API to help you to find items that are similar to the things that you like. If you have ever wondered what artists, movies, books, authors, games, or podcast were similar to the ones you like, 6 degrees can help you find it. What makes this app interesting is that it allows you to do searches of the results that might interest you up to 6 times. This creating a six degrees of similarity between your initial search and the final search item. 

the app allows you to refine your search in three ways. 
1. Results returned: The app allows you to change how many results are displayed with the default being 6, 
2. Specific Input item: If your search item has a name in two categories, you can refine your search by specifying the category for example. Harry Potter and the Golbet of fire: book, Harry Potter and the Golbet of fire: movie, Harry Potter and the Golbet of fire: game.
3. Limit results Category: You can restrict the results you get to a specific category of game, author, movie, tv show, music, and podcast.

Each search results comes with a little information about the search results, linking to the wikipedia page for you to read more about the search results. The app also tries to pull an image of the search item from the Wikimedia API.

You are also able to go back to a previous search if you want to search other results. however, you can only ever go back one step.
